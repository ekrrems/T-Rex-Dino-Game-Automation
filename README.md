# T-Rex-Dino-Game-Automation

This project is going to help you to understand how to gather data from screen images, how to create a Convolutional Neural Network Model and how to apply this model into a real life problem.


<h2>1. Trex_Data_gathering.py</h2>
<p>In this python file you can find how to save screen when you press a key on the keyboard and how to save that image into a file.</p>
<h2>2. Trex_Model_Creating.py</h2>
<p>This file includes code lines about importing images into your environment, resizing/reshaping them to your preference and training/saving a CNN Model.</p>
<h2>3. Trex_game_play.py</h2>
<p>In this file you will find about how you can use your CNN Model in real life. After running this python file you have to open T-Rex Game site for code to move the Dino in the screen.</p>
